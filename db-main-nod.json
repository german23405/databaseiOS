    "firstParagraph": "ProtonVPN is another provider that offers a free VPN alongside a paid option, but the former has some very strong points. The most notable of which is that it doesnâ€™t impose any data restrictions. In other words, youâ€™re free to use as much data as you want every month. That's highly rare for a free VPN provider and immediately makes it well worth considering.",

    "secondParagraph": "There are, naturally enough, limitations for the free plan to incentivize upgrading to a paid-for offering. And ProtonVPN Freeâ€™s restrictions include limiting you to only one device, only three locations, and free users get a lower priority when it comes to speed compared to paying subscribers. Thereâ€™s no P2P support either and speeds may drop at peak times when lots of users are around and paying folks get priority.",
